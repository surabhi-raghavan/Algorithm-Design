"""
Design and implement your own algorithm that takes the array A with size m+n as input where:
Subarray A[1], A[2],...A[m] sorted in ascending order
Subarray A[m+1], A[m+2],...A[n] sorted in ascending order
and merges the two subarrays using an auxiliary array Aux of size min {m, n} back into array A sorted in ascending order. You must design and implement your own sorting function. Use of sorting functions in libraries is not permitted.
